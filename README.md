Here I've gathered a few things together for our `R` review session. Please have a look through this document to make sure you're ready and we can avoid spending most of our time on installation issues. 

Installing `R`/`RStudio`
=============

The first order of business is to make sure you have `R` and `RStudio` up and running. If you do not have these set up, do the following, in order.
1. Install `R`.
2. Install `RStudio`.

-- **Install `R`**

**For Windows:** 
1. Download the binary setup file for `R` [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).
2. Open the downloaded .exe file and Install `R`.
